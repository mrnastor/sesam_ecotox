On September 08, the Ecotox lab conducted an emergency fieldwork to reinforce and check the safety of the deployed diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) samplers. The team retrieved and re-tie the DGT canisters to ensure its sturdiness against the strong waves brought by the typhoon. They purposely revisited the critical sites in Pila, Los Banos, and Santa Rosa.
